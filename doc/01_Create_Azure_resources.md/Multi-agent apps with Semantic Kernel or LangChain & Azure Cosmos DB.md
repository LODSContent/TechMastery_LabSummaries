## Exercise Summary
### C# Path (Semantic Kernel Agents)
- **Goal:** Build a retail banking multi-agent app in C#.
- **Actions:** Set up SK Agents, implement Modules 0–5 (agent orchestration, state management, Cosmos DB integration).
- **Validation:** Agents collaborate to process user queries and persist results.

### Python Path (LangGraph)
- **Goal:** Alternate implementation of banking app in Python.
- **Actions:** Follow equivalent Modules 0–5 using LangGraph for agent coordination and Cosmos DB persistence.
- **Validation:** Python multi-agent system mirrors C# functionality.

### Cross-validation
- **Goal:** Compare approaches.
- **Actions:** Contrast agent orchestration between SK and LangGraph.
- **Validation:** Both solutions run end-to-end.
